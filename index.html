          <p class="lead">While the Trump administration’s policy change has decreased refugee admissions across nationality, the change in policy has disproportionately 
            impacted refugees from Muslim-majority nations. Refugees from Muslim-majority nations made up 47% of total refugees resettled in the United States in 2016. 
            In 2018 that share had fallen to just 9%.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The number of Somali refugees fell from 9,020 in 2016 to 267 in 2018.</li>
              <li>The number of Iraqi refugees fell from 9,880 in 2016 to just 140 in 2018.</li> 
              <li>The number of Syrian refugees fell from 12,587 in 2016 to just 62 in 2018. </li>
            </ul>   
            <p class="lead"> The policy change has had varying impacts across the country. Michigan, for example, went from having 3,042 refugee come from Muslim-majority nations  
              (71% of total) to just 86 in 2018 (13% of total). In Texas, the number fell from 3,578 in 2016 (46% of total) to just 149 (9% of total). In 2016, 75% of states had at 
              least a third of their refugees coming from Muslim-majority nations. By 2018, no state had at least a third of their refugees coming from a Muslim-majority nation. 
              Additionally, 8 states and DC had no refugees from Muslim-majority nation settled in their jurisdiction. </p>

          <h2>Services we offer</h2>
          <p class="lead">Misinformation has driven many negative conceptions about refugees, particularly those coming from Muslim-majority nations. However, emerging research is disproving these myths. A recent report from Stanford University’s Immigration Policy Lab indicates that reducing the number of refugees in a community does not reduce the crime rate. Research from the Center for American Progress find that refugees quickly become self-sufficient and, in the long-run, become well-integrated into society, having similar rates of labor force participation, wages and business ownership as their U.S. born neighbors. Rather than being a financial burden to the U.S., research found that between 2005 and 2013 refugees and asylees contributed $63 billion more in taxes than they used in public services.</p>
