          <h2>Countries of Origin</h2>
          <p class="lead">While the Trump administration’s policy change has decreased refugee admissions across nationalities, the change in policy has disproportionately
            impacted refugees from Muslim-majority nations. Refugees from Muslim-majority nations made up 47% of total refugees resettled in the United States in 2016.
            In 2018 that share had fallen to just 9%.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The number of Somali refugees fell from 9,020 in 2016 to 267 in 2018.</li>
              <li>The number of Iraqi refugees fell from 9,880 in 2016 to 140 in 2018.</li> 
              <li>The number of Syrian refugees fell from 12,587 in 2016 to just 62 in 2018.</li>
            </ul>   
            <p class="lead"> These changes to the refugee acceptance policies have had varying impacts across the country. Michigan, for example, went from receiving 3,042 refugees from Muslim-majority nations
              (71% of total) to just 86 in 2018 (13% of total). In Texas, the number fell from 3,578 in 2016 (46% of total) to just 149 (9% of total). In 2016, 75% of states had at
              least a third of their refugees coming from Muslim-majority nations. By 2018, no state had at least a third of their refugees coming from a Muslim-majority nation, with 8 states and DC receiving no refugees from Muslim-majority nations at all.
              Even if a state wants to admit more refugees they have little recourse for influencing the number of refugees resettled in their jurisdiction. </p>

            <h2>What determines where refugees are resettled within the United States?</h2>
            <p class="lead"> Once a refugee is admitted into the United States, they are matched with a nonprofit Volunteer Resettlement Agency (VOLAG) 
              who is tasked with providing sponsorship, initial housing, food, clothing, orientation, and counseling. These organizations are scattered 
              across the country and rely primarily on federal funding to support their activities. The decrease in refugees admissions has already resulted 
              in the closure of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-refugees-exclusive/exclusive-dozens-of-refugee-resettlement-offices-to-close-as-trump-downsizes-program-idUSKCN1FY1EJ">dozens of VOLAG offices across the country</a>, 
              with the government submitting a plan to close nearly a quarter of the offices, eliminating offices in Hawaii, West Virginia, and Louisiana all together. 
              Misinformation has driven many negative conceptions about refugees, particularly those coming from Muslim-majority nations. 
              
              <br>However, emerging research is disproving these myths. A recent report from Stanford University’s Immigration Policy Lab indicates that reducing 
              the number of refugees in a community does not reduce the crime rate. Research from the Center for American Progress find that refugees quickly become 
              self-sufficient and, in the long-run, become well-integrated into society, having similar rates of labor force participation, wages and business ownership 
              as their U.S. born neighbors. Rather than being a financial burden to the U.S., research found that between 2005 and 2013 refugees and asylees contributed $63 billion 
              more in taxes than they utilized in public services. <br/> </p>

                  One of the first policy decisions made by the Trump administration was to halt refugee settlement in the United States. On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, commonly known as the Muslim Ban, which barred entry from seven Muslim-majority nations and
                  imposed a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States. While the courts intervened to dismantle portions of the ban, in October, 2017 the administration passed new vetting policies that further slowed resettlement processes and imposed a new 90-day ban on 11 countries, including nine Muslim-Majority countries.<br />
      
                  <br>
                  These federal actions resulted in a dramatic slowdown in domestic refugee resettlement. Despite the 110,000 ceiling in 2017, the United States only resettled 53,716 refugees. In 2018, the Trump administration further reduced the cap to a nearly 40-year low of 45,000, and, over the course of the year, resettled less
                  than half of that target (22,491). In 2019, the Trump Administration announced it would further reduce the cap to 30,000 refugees and, as of May 2019,<a href="http://www.wrapsnet.org/admissions-and-arrivals"> the country is well short of reaching that limit.</a>
                  These reductions in United States refugee resettlement are coming at a time when the number of refugees worldwide is growing. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR), the number of refugees globally nearly doubled between 2012 and 2017, from 10.4 million to 19.9 million over the five years. As a result the United States is further exacerbating the global refugee crisis.
